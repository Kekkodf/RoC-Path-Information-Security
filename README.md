# Review of Cryptography (RoC Path)
## Review of Cryptography for the course of Information Security at UniPd

The RoC path of the course in Information Security is a part of the course where students are invated to implement several techniques for a better comprehension in the cryptographic mechanism introduced by the Professor during the lectures.

My collegues [Luca Cosuti](https://github.com/lucaatme), [Saverio Cavasin](https://github.com/SvrCvs) and I partecipated both in the first and the second Lab experience. For both experience a Report can be found in the Lab directory.

The name of the group is TCP - Treviso Campari Piacenza.

## Task 1 - Simple AES implementation

## Task 2 - Encryption, eavsdropper and Binary Simmetric Channel errors

## Task 3 - Authentication schema
Implementing a simple authentication schema without using any cryptographic algorithm and then computing a tag for checking the integrity of the message.
